This is a prototype that uses the Angular 5 framework for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end.  MongoDB is used for 
the database.

This repository holds the client side code (Angular 5).  The server side code can be found 
[here](https://github.com/AJarombek/mean-server-prototype)

The reason for this prototype is to explore using the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) web application stack.  I want
to compare the MEAN stack with the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React.js, Node.js) stack for use in my personal website and blog 
`jarombek.com`.

There will be discovery posts for this prototype [here](https://github.com/AJarombek/jarombek-com-submittions)
